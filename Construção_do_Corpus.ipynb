            "Start your NLP journey with no-code tools TRY NOW In this guide, you’ll learn about the basics of  Natural Language Processing  and some of its challenges, and discover the most popular  NLP applications  in business.  \n",

            "Challenges of Natural Language Processing Natural Language Processing Examples Natural Language Processing with Python Natural Language Processing (NLP) Tutorial What Is Natural Language Processing (NLP)?\n",
            "Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of Artificial Intelligence (AI)  that makes human language intelligible to machines.\n",
            "NLP combines the power of linguistics and computer science to study the rules and structure of language, and create intelligent systems (run on machine learning and NLP algorithms) capable of understanding, analyzing, and extracting meaning from text and speech.\n",
            "What Is NLP Used For?\n",
            "NLP is used to  understand the structure and meaning of human language  by analyzing different aspects like syntax, semantics, pragmatics, and morphology.\n",
            "Then, computer science transforms this linguistic knowledge into rule-based,  machine learning algorithms  that can solve specific problems and perform desired tasks.\n",
            "Take Gmail, for example.\n",
            "Emails are automatically categorized as  Promotions ,  Social ,  Primary , or  Spam , thanks to an NLP task called  keyword extraction .\n",
            "By “reading” words in subject lines and associating them with predetermined tags, machines automatically learn which category to assign emails.\n",
            "NLP Benefits\n",
            "There are many  benefits of NLP , but here are just a few top-level benefits that will help your business become more competitive: Perform large-scale analysis.  \n",
            "Natural Language Processing helps machines automatically understand and analyze huge amounts of  unstructured text data , like social media comments, customer support tickets, online reviews, news reports, and more.  \n",
            "Automate processes in real-time.  \n",
            "Natural language processing tools can help machines learn to sort and route information with little to no human interaction – quickly, efficiently, accurately, and around the clock.\n",
            "Tailor NLP tools to your industry.  \n",
            "Natural language processing algorithms can be tailored to your needs and criteria, like complex, industry-specific language – even sarcasm and misused words.\n",
            "How Does Natural Language Processing Work?\n",
            "Using  text vectorization , NLP tools transform text into something a machine can understand, then machine learning algorithms are fed  training data  and expected outputs (tags) to train machines to make associations between a particular input and its corresponding output.\n",
            "Machines then use statistical analysis methods to build their own “knowledge bank” and discern which features best represent the texts, before making predictions for unseen data (new texts):\n",
            "Ultimately, the more data these NLP algorithms are fed, the more accurate the text analysis models will be.\n",
            "Sentiment analysis  (seen in the above chart) is one of the most popular NLP tasks, where machine learning models are trained to classify text by polarity of opinion (positive, negative, neutral, and everywhere in between).  \n",
            "Try out sentiment analysis for yourself by typing text in the NLP model, below Test with your own text This is the best sentiment analysis tool ever!!!\n",
            "Classify Text Results Tag Confidence Positive 99.1% The biggest advantage of machine learning models is their ability to learn on their own, with no need to define manual rules.\n",
            "You just need a set of relevant training data with several examples for the tags you want to analyze.\n",
            "And with advanced deep learning algorithms, you’re able to chain together multiple natural language processing tasks, like sentiment analysis, keyword extraction,  topic classification ,  intent detection , and more, to work simultaneously for super fine-grained results.\n",
            "Common NLP Tasks & Techniques Many natural language processing tasks involve syntactic and  semantic analysis , used to break down human language into machine-readable chunks.\n",
            "Syntactic analysis , also known as parsing or syntax analysis, identifies the syntactic structure of a text and the dependency relationships between words, represented on a diagram called a parse tree.\n",
            "Semantic analysis  focuses on identifying the meaning of language.\n",
            "However, since language is polysemic and ambiguous, semantics is considered one of the most challenging areas in NLP.  \n",
            "Semantic tasks analyze the structure of sentences, word interactions, and related concepts, in an attempt to discover the meaning of words, as well as understand the topic of a text.  \n",
            "Below, we’ve listed some of the main sub-tasks of both semantic and syntactic analysis:  Tokenization Tokenization is an essential task in natural language processing used to break up a string of words into semantically useful units called  tokens .  \n",
            "Sentence tokenization splits sentences within a text, and word tokenization splits words within a sentence.\n",
            "Generally, word tokens are separated by blank spaces, and sentence tokens by stops.\n",
            "However, you can perform high-level tokenization for more complex structures, like words that often go together, otherwise known as collocations (e.g.,  New York ).  \n",
            "An example of how word tokenization simplifies text: Here’s an example of how word tokenization simplifies text: Customer service couldn’t be better!\n",
            "= “customer service” “could” “not” “be” “better”.  \n",
            "Part-of-speech tagging Part-of-speech tagging (abbreviated as PoS tagging) involves adding a part of speech category to each token within a text.\n",
            "Some common PoS tags are  verb ,  adjective ,  noun ,  pronoun ,  conjunction ,  preposition ,  intersection , among others.\n",
            "In this case, the example above would look like this: “Customer service”: NOUN, “could”: VERB, “not”: ADVERB, be”: VERB, “better”: ADJECTIVE, “!”: PUNCTUATION PoS tagging is useful for identifying relationships between words and, therefore, understand the meaning of sentences.\n",
            "Dependency Parsing Dependency grammar  refers to the way the words in a sentence are connected.\n",
            "A dependency parser, therefore, analyzes how ‘head words’ are related and modified by other words too understand the syntactic structure of a sentence:\n",
            "Constituency Parsing Constituency Parsing aims to visualize the entire syntactic structure of a sentence by identifying  phrase structure grammar .\n",
            "It consists of using abstract terminal and non-terminal nodes associated to words, as shown in this example: You can try different parsing algorithms and strategies depending on the nature of the text you intend to analyze, and the level of complexity you’d like to achieve.\n",
            "Lemmatization & Stemming When we speak or write, we tend to use inflected forms of a word (words in their different grammatical forms).\n",
            "To make these words easier for computers to understand, NLP uses lemmatization and stemming to transform them back to their root form.\n",
            "The word as it appears in the dictionary – its root form – is called a lemma.\n",
            "For example, the terms  \"is, are, am, were, and been,”  are grouped under the lemma  ‘be.’  \n",
            "So, if we apply this lemmatization to  “African elephants have four nails on their front feet,”  the result will look something like this: African elephants have four nails on their front feet = “African,” “elephant,” “have,” “4”, “nail,” “on,” “their,” “foot”]\n",
            "This example is useful to see how the lemmatization changes the sentence using its base form (e.g., the word \"feet\"\" was changed to \"foot\").\n",
            "When we refer to stemming, the root form of a word is called a stem.\n",
            "Stemming \"trims\" words, so word stems may not always be semantically correct.  \n",
            "For example, stemming the words “consult,” “consultant,” “consulting,” and “consultants” would result in the root form “consult.”\n",
            "While lemmatization is dictionary-based and chooses the appropriate lemma based on context, stemming operates on single words without considering the context.\n",
            "For example, in the sentence: “This is better” The word “better” is transformed into the word “good” by a lemmatizer but is unchanged by stemming.\n",
            "Even though stemmers can lead to less-accurate results, they are easier to build and perform faster than lemmatizers.\n",
            "But lemmatizers are recommended if you're seeking more precise linguistic rules.\n",
            "Stopword Removal Removing stop words is an essential step in NLP text processing.\n",
            "It involves filtering out high-frequency words that add little or no semantic value to a sentence, for example,  which, to, at, for, is,  etc.\n",
            "You can even customize lists of stopwords to include words that you want to ignore.\n",
            "Let’s say you want to classify customer service tickets based on their topics.\n",
            "In this example:  “Hello, I’m having trouble logging in with my new password” , it may be useful to remove stop words like  “hello” ,  “I” ,  “am” ,  “with” ,  “my” , so you’re left with the words that help you understand the topic of the ticket:  “trouble” ,  “logging in” ,  “new” ,  “password” .\n",
            "Word Sense Disambiguation Depending on their context, words can have different meanings.\n",
            "Take the word  “book” , for example: You should read this  book ; it’s a great novel!\n",
            "You should  book  the flights as soon as possible.\n",
            "You should close the  books  by the end of the year.\n",
            "You should do everything by the  book  to avoid potential complications.\n",
            "There are two main techniques that can be used for word sense disambiguation (WSD):  knowledge-based (or dictionary approach)  or  supervised approach .\n",
            "The first one tries to infer meaning by observing the dictionary definitions of ambiguous terms within a text, while the latter is based on natural language processing algorithms that learn from training data.\n",
            "Named Entity Recognition (NER) Named entity recognition  is one of the most popular tasks in semantic analysis and involves extracting entities from within a text.\n",
            "Entities can be  names, places, organizations, email addresses, and more.  \n",
            "Relationship extraction, another sub-task of NLP, goes one step further and finds relationships between two nouns.\n",
            "For example, in the phrase  “Susan lives in Los Angeles,”  a person  (Susan)  is related to a place  (Los Angeles)  by the semantic category “lives in.”\n",
            "Text Classification Text classification  is the process of understanding the meaning of unstructured text and organizing it into predefined categories (tags).\n",
            "One of the most popular text classification tasks is sentiment analysis, which aims to categorize unstructured data by sentiment.  \n",
            "Other classification tasks include intent detection,  topic modeling , and language detection.\n",
            "Challenges of  Natural Language Processing There are many  challenges in Natural language processing  but one of the main reasons NLP is difficult is simply because human language is ambiguous.  \n",
            "Even humans struggle to analyze and classify human language correctly.  \n",
            "Take sarcasm, for example.\n",
            "How do you teach a machine to understand an expression that’s used to say the opposite of what’s true?\n",
            "While humans would easily detect sarcasm in this comment, below, it would be challenging to teach a machine how to interpret this phrase: “If I had a dollar for every smart thing you say, I’d be poor.”\n",
            "To fully comprehend human language, data scientists need to teach NLP tools to look beyond definitions and word order, to understand context, word ambiguities, and other complex concepts connected to messages.\n",
            "But, they also need to consider other aspects, like culture, background, and gender, when fine-tuning natural language processing models.\n",
            "Sarcasm and humor, for example, can vary greatly from one country to the next.  \n",
            "Natural language processing and powerful machine learning algorithms (often multiple used in collaboration) are improving, and bringing order to the chaos of human language, right down to concepts like sarcasm.\n",
            "We are also starting to see  new trends in NLP , so we can expect NLP to revolutionize the way humans and technology collaborate in the near future and beyond.\n",
            "Natural Language Processing Examples\n",
            "Although natural language processing continues to evolve, there are already many ways in which it is being used today.\n",
            "Most of the time you’ll be exposed to natural language processing without even realizing it.  \n",
            "Often, NLP is running in the background of the tools and applications we use everyday, helping businesses improve our experiences.\n",
            "Below, we've highlighted some of the most common and most powerful uses of natural language processing in everyday life: 11 Common Examples of NLP Email filters Virtual assistants, voice assistants, or smart speakers Online search engines Predictive text and autocorrect Monitor brand sentiment on social media Sorting customer feedback Automating processes in customer support Chatbots Automatic summarization Machine translation Natural language generation Email filters As mentioned above, email filters are one of the most common and most basic uses of NLP.\n",
            "When they were first introduced, they weren’t entirely accurate, but with years of machine learning training on millions of data samples, emails rarely slip into the wrong inbox these days.\n",
            "Virtual assistants, voice assistants, or smart speakers The most common being  Apple’s Siri  and  Amazon’s Alexa , virtual assistants use NLP machine learning technology to understand and automatically process voice requests.\n",
            "Natural language processing algorithms allow the assistants to be custom-trained by individual users with no additional input, to learn from previous interactions, recall related queries, and connect to other apps.  \n",
            "The use of voice assistants is expected to continue to grow exponentially as they are used to control home security systems, thermostats, lights, and cars – even let you know what you’re running low on in the refrigerator.\n",
            "Online search engines Whenever you do a simple Google search, you’re using NLP machine learning.\n",
            "They use highly trained algorithms that, not only search for related words, but for the intent of the searcher.\n",
            "Results often change on a daily basis, following trending queries and morphing right along with human language.\n",
            "They even learn to suggest topics and subjects related to your query that you may not have even realized you were interested in.\n",
            "Predictive text Every time you type a text on your smartphone, you see NLP in action.\n",
            "You often only have to type a few letters of a word, and the texting app will suggest the correct one for you.\n",
            "And the more you text, the more accurate it becomes, often recognizing commonly used words and names faster than you can type them.\n",
            "Predictive text, autocorrect, and autocomplete have become so accurate in word processing programs, like MS Word and Google Docs, that they can make us feel like we need to go back to grammar school.\n",
            "Monitor brand sentiment on social media Sentiment analysis  is the automated process of classifying opinions in a text as positive, negative, or neutral.\n",
            "It’s often used to  monitor sentiments on social media.  \n",
            "You can track and analyze sentiment in comments about your overall brand, a product, particular feature, or compare your brand to your competition.  \n",
            "Imagine you’ve just released a new product and want to detect your customers’ initial reactions.\n",
            "Maybe a customer tweeted discontent about your customer service.\n",
            "By tracking sentiment analysis, you can spot these negative comments right away and respond immediately.\n",
            "Quickly sorting customer feedback Text classification  is a core NLP task that assigns predefined categories (tags) to a text, based on its content.  \n",
            "It’s great for organizing qualitative feedback (product reviews, social media conversations, surveys, etc.) into appropriate subjects or department categories.\n",
            "Retently , a SaaS platform,  used NLP tools to classify NPS responses  and gain actionable insights in next to no time: Retently discovered  the most relevant topics mentioned by customers, and which ones they valued most.\n",
            "Below, you can see that most of the responses referred to “Product Features,” followed by “Product UX” and “Customer Support” (the last two topics were mentioned mostly by Promoters).\n",
            "Automating processes in customer service Other interesting applications of NLP revolve around  customer service automation .\n",
            "This concept uses AI-based technology to eliminate or reduce routine manual tasks in customer support, saving agents valuable time, and making processes more efficient.\n",
            "According to the  Zendesk benchmark , a tech company receives +2600 support inquiries per month.\n",
            "Receiving large amounts of support tickets from different channels (email, social media, live chat, etc), means companies need to have a strategy in place to categorize each incoming ticket.\n",
            "Text classification allows companies to  automatically tag incoming customer support tickets  according to their topic, language, sentiment, or urgency.\n",
            "Then, based on these tags, they can instantly  route tickets to the most appropriate pool of agents .  \n",
            "Uber designed its own  ticket routing workflow , which involves tagging tickets by  Country, Language, and Type  (this category includes the sub-tags  Driver-Partner, Questions about Payments, Lost Items, etc ), and following some prioritization rules, like sending requests from new customers ( New Driver-Partners ) are sent to the top of the list.\n",
            "Chatbots A chatbot is a computer program that simulates human conversation.\n",
